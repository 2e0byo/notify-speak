#+title: Text-to-speak for dbus notifications

A very basic script to intercept dbus notifications and fire them at you with a
text-to-speech engine.

* Usage

  Edit ~notify_speak.py~ to use the right executable.  Then run.

** Pausing
   Use standard process control, e.g. ~pkill -STOP notify_speak.py~.
   
* Extending

  You likely want only to speak /some/ notifications: perhaps from a certain
  program, perhaps only if some other conditions obtain.  Python is easy!  Edit as required and implement for your setup.

  Doubtless there's a way with ~pydbus~, but I couldn't figure it out.
